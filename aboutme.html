<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Jailene Hernandez, and I am a New York City based digital designer and artist. I am passionate about creating visually appealing designs that communicate an idea and engage audiences. I enjoy the process of creating and problem solving to help others bring their ideas to life.</p>
<p>Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Multimedia Programming and Design at BMCC, where I am developing my skills in graphic design and multimedia products. Through my coursework, I have gained a foundation in design principles and software proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite.</p>
<p>If you are interested in collaborating or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

      <h1>Supporting Pets in the Community</h1>
    
    <h2>By Jailene Hernandez</h2> 

    <p> My social cause is about supporting pets in the community because small acts can help keep pets and families togther. I was inspired by the Pets and People Together campaign because I have some background caring for pets. I did a comic about a rescue dog that is adopted by a volunteer, then taken to the vet, and helped by donations of money, food, and supplies.
